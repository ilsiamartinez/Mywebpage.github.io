  <h1 style="border:2px teal;">What I Plan To Do After High School</h1>
  
  <b> College Plan </b>
  <p>After I graduate from high school, I want to attend a four year college. My dream college is Emory 
  University. <a href="https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html">Here's the Website!</a> 
  I want to major in Biology. During college, I want to intern at a veterinary clinic to get experience in
  the field. I plan to get all A's in college so that my GPA can be at least a 3.7. </p>
  
  <b> Plan After College </b>  
  <p>If I do get in Vet School, I want to complete those four years. I want to be able to perform surgery
  on any type of animal. I want to be able to help animals give birth. I saw a video of a Vet Doctor that 
  helped a horse give birth to her foal (baby horse). </p>
    
  <b> Here is a list of my favorite animals </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Dogs</li>
      <li>Bunnies</li>
      <li>Birds</li>
      <li>Pigs</li>
      <li>Horses</li>
      <li>Cats</li>
    </ul>
