<h1 style="border:2px teal;">What I Plan To Do After High SChool</h1>
<p>After I graduate from high school, I want to attend a four year college. My dream college is Emory
University. <a herf="https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">Here's the website!</a>.
I want to major in Biology. During college, I want to intern at a Veterinary clinic to get experience in the field. 
I plan to get all A's in College so that my GPA can be at least a 3.7. </p>

<p>If I do get in Vet school, I want to complete those four years. I want to be able to perform surgery
on any type of animal. I want to be able to help animals give birth. I saw a video of a Vet Doctor that
helped a horse give birth to her foal (baby horse). </p>

Here is a list of my favorite animals:
<ul>
<li>Dogs</li>
<li>Bunnies</li>
<li>Birds</li>
<li>Pigs</li>
<li>Horses</li>
<li>Cats</li>
</ul>
