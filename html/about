  ## Here are some things you should know about me!

  <p> 
  My name is Ilsia Martinez-Perez. I am seventeen years old. I am left handed. When people find out that I'm 
  left handed, they think it's cool but It's actually a pain. I contantly bump into someone's shoulder when I'm 
  writing. Anyways, I'm an animal lover, if you did not know. My favorit color is navy blue.
